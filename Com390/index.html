		<div id="about">
			<p>		My name is Josh Haag. I am a senior at Fresno Pacific University and my area of study is Graphic Design. I enjoy making concert posters for bands that I like and bands that my friends like as well. Digital Illustration is a passion of mine and I like using Adobe Illustrator to make my ideas come to life!</p>

				This poster was designed for my "Exploring Color" class. This final project took about 8 hours of work to make this 24"x36" poster of Breaking Bad. 
				<br></br>
				<img src="com390-final/changeposter.jpg" />
				This is a poster I designed in my free time. It is supposed to be able to be used as a poster promoting the band "Deftones" and an upcoming concert that could be having.
